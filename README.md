## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom propertie

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to handle responsive media queries better, which was amazing. I also revisited a helpful YouTube tutorial that guided me through some tricky parts. I worked on this project independently, which helped me improve my problem-solving skills.

Hereâ€™s an example of the responsive CSS I implemented:

```css
.proud-of-this-css @media (max-width: 374px) {
  .card {
    width: 100%;
  }
  h1 {
    font-size: 18px;
  }
}
```



### Continued development
I want to continue improving my CSS skills, focusing on creating more responsive layouts, mastering flexbox and grid, and refining my design and styling techniques for future projects.
